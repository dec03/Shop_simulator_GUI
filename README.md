# Shop_simulator_GUI

The code in the server.py and database_creation.py that connects the script to the SQL workbench using my 'sql connector' library can be changed to your local credentials used for your own  database.

I added a login stage to access the server as well but it did not work, however evrything else works, so dont launch the server from the authorisation.py file.

To run the programs, first open server.py, then open client.py and enter your name or random characters to start the server, otherwise if you click on the client GUI buttons to send data to the server, it will crash.
